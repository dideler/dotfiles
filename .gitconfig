[alias]
# Check out https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Aliases

# aliases work regardless of which shell you're using (e.g. fish shell).
  
  rewrite-commit-msg = commit --amend
  # Allows you to rewrite the most recent commit message.
  # Note that this will change the id of the commit.
  # You're effectively creating a new commit to replace the old one.
  # 
  # You can also reword the last (or older) commit messages with git rebase and
  # the reword operation.
  #
  # Both amend and rebase will rewrite history.
  # Do NOT use them if you've already pushed your commits to a shared repo.
  #
  # NOTE: --amend can also be used to take staged changes and push them into the
  #       previous commit. The add-to-last-commit alias is used for this, and
  #       does the staging part for you.

  add-to-last-commit = !bash -c 'git add "$@" && git commit --amend' -
  # Takes unstaged changes (of given files) and adds them to the previous commit.
  # Or if no args provided, takes the staged changes and adds them to the previous commit.
  # Useful when adding small chunks to a WIP commit.
  # Equivalent to: uncommit + add changes + recommit
  #
  # Alternatively, you can create lots of temporary commits and squash them
  # together using git rebase and the pick and squash operations.

  undo = reset --hard
  # Discards all changes since the last commit.
  # This includes unstaging of all files _and_ undoing any modifications.
  # Note that "git checkout" can only undo changes prior to staging.
  # WARNING: Dangerous command, if you want to unstage, use `git unadd`.

  unstage = reset
  unadd = reset HEAD
  # Undo staging of all or given files.
  # Usage: git unstage        # unstages all
  #        git unstage .      # unstages all
  #        git unstage <file> # unstages file

  uncommit = reset --soft HEAD^
  # Undo a commit.

  recommit = commit -c ORIG_HEAD

  ##alias = config --get-regexp alias

  # A neater display of all git aliases.

  rm-remote-file = rm --cached # <filename>
  # Remove a given file from the remote branch.

  rm-remote-branch = !sh -c 'git push origin --delete refs/heads/"$1"' -
  rm-remote-tag = !sh -c 'push origin --delete refs/tags/"$1"' -
  # Remove the remote tag or tracking branch (e.g. on GitHub).
  # Note that without the "refs/.../" it will delete either a branch or tag,
  # or fail if there is a tag and branch with the same name.

  overwrite = !bash -c 'git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/master'
  # Local repo will exactly match the remote tracking branch.

  pull-rebase = pull --rebase
  # Reapplies commits so history stays linear (use for regular syncing).

  unmerged-branches = branch --no-merged
  # Find local unmerged branches.

  unstash = stash apply
  # Restore stashed modifications (potentially on top a different commit).

  unpush = push -f origin HEAD~1:master
  # Undo a push. Replace 1 with number of pushes to undo.
  # Warning: Do not rewrite history is someone has pulled your changes!
  # Note: HEAD~1 means exactly the same thing as HEAD^, "the commit before HEAD".

  merge-topic-branch = merge --no-ff
  # No fast-forward merge. Shows branch in history as merge commit.
  # Use on master to ship a feature (i.e. merging finished feature into master).
  # (on master) git merge-topic-branch feature
  #
  # However, if topic branch contains only 1 commit, avoid the merge commit.
  # (on master) git cherry-pick feature

  hash = hash-object # <filename>

  # Show SHA1 of last commit on origin.

  release = tag -a
  # Create an annotated tag for major version releases (e.g. v2.6 or v3.0).
  # Use lightweight tags for smaller releases (e.g. git tag v2.5.3).

  heroku = remote add heroku # git@heroku.com:project.git
  # Add a heroku remote for a heroku web app; not needed if you 'heroku create'.
  # Alternatively, you can use the heroku toolbelt CLI:
  # heroku git:remote -a project, where project is the project name on heroku.

  show-new-commits = !sh -c 'git log $1@{1}..$1@{0} "$@"'
  # See what new commits have been created by the last command
  # (e.g. after a "git pull")

  add-note = notes add
  # Opens the editor to add a note to the last commit

  show-remote-branches = !bash -c 'echo "One sec..." && git fetch && git branch --remotes --verbose'
  # If you want to checkout out a remote branch, simply 'git checkout <name>'.
  # On older versions of git: git checkout --track origin/branch
  
  shallow-clone = clone --depth 1
  # Clone the repo with no history.
  # Be careful, you may not be able to push or pull.

  add-all = add --all
  # Adds all new and modified content and removes content from index that's no
  # longer in working tree.

  add-modified = add --update .
  # Adds all modified content in the current directory to the staging area,
  # and removes content from index if content has been removed from working tree.

  add-all-modified = add --update :/
  # Similar to `add-modified` but works on the whole tree, not just cwd.

  add-new = !git add $(git ls-files -o --exclude-standard)
  # Adds only all new content to the staging area.

  diff-staged = diff --staged
  # Diff staged (but uncommitted) changes. Default is unstaged changes.
  # --cached also works
  
  diff-since-commit = diff HEAD
  # View changes since your last commit.
  # Compares your last commit with your working directory.
  
  show-space = diff --check
  # Shows trailing whitespace and spaces before tabs in unstaged changes.

  abort-merge = merge --abort
  # Aborts a conflicted merge and resets the tree.

  clean-untracked = !git-clean
  # Cleans untracked files and directories in the working copy.
  # This uses a custom script. See ~/.config/fish/functions/git-clean.fish

  pu = !"git fetch origin -v; git fetch upstream -v; git merge upstream/master"
  # Grab all of the latest changes from both remotes, and then merge in the
  # commits from upstream. Helps to merge in changes easily.

  show-last = !git last -p
  # Shows the last commit with code changes.

  log-no-merges = !git lg --no-merges
  # Don't show merges in my concise log.

  nuke-branch = !sh -c 'git branch -D "$1" && git push origin --delete "$1"' -
  # Nukes a branch locally and on the origin remote.

  ignore-versioned-file = !git update-index --assume-unchanged
  # Ignore a versioned file by assuming it's unchanged.
  # Usage: git ignore-versioned-file /path/to/file
  # Note: Use this for versioned files that are often changed but rarely
  #       committed (e.g. local configuration files).
  #       Do not use this for files you accidentally versioned and want to
  #       ignore! Use `git rm --cached /path/to/file` instead.

  unignore-versioned-file = !git update-index --no-assume-unchanged 
  # Tracks a versioned file that you previously ignored.
  # See ignore-versioned-file alias.

  untrack = !git rm --cached
  # Untrack a file/directory.
  # Usage: git untrack /path/to/file
  # Note: Don't forget to add file/dir to your .gitignore!
  #       For collaborative environments, consider update-index instead.

  prune-origin = fetch --prune origin
  # Clean up all local tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote.
  # Use when old remote branches are polluting your auto-completion.
  
  housekeeping = gc --aggressive
  # Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository.
  # Run this task on a regular basis within each repository.

  view-topic-commits = !sh -c 'git log master..'
  # Shows a list of commits in the current topic branch so far.
  # Of course you can also see this on GitHub.
  # Use within topic branch.
  
  view-topic-changes = !sh -c 'git diff master'
  # Diff of all the changes that the topic branch will introduce.
  # Use within topic branch.

  today = !git log --since=midnight --author="$(git config user.name)" --oneline

  co = checkout
  # Using a shell alias (e.g. gco) doesn't provide branch name auto-completion.

  # Note that you can also use (local) functions for aliases. E.g.
  # foo = "!f() { echo "$1"; }; f"

  ### TIPS
  #
  # Grab files from a branch that don't exist in the current branch:
  #   git checkout <branch> <paths>
  #
  # If GitHub is asking for your username and password on a push, it's probably
  # because you cloned using HTTPS instead of SSH. Fix with:
  #   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
  #
  # Show the last commit that matches a regex:
  #   git show :/pattern
  #   git show :/^Merge
